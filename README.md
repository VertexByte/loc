Loc is still not finished.

Here is a todo list.

- Switch to Win32 File IO

- Make directories as a valid input.

- Differentiate between files and directories.

- Implement an easy way to add a new programming language to program.

- Sorting programming language entries by file extension.
  (The program could be optimized by just not doing this step, by
   already having the entries sorted at compile time)
   But this step is also needed because people can add new programming
   languages.
     
- Binary search for programming language entries when processing.
