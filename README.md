Loc is still not finished.

Done so far:

- Switch to Win32 File IO
- Differentiate between files and directories.

Here is a todo list.

- Make directories as a valid input.

- Implement an easy way to add a new programming language to program.

- Sorting programming language entries by file extension.
  (The program could be optimized by just not doing this step, by
   already having the entries sorted at compile time)
   But this step is also needed because people can add new programming
   languages.
     
- Binary search for programming language entries when processing.
